Needed functionality:

retrieve the stored settings
	- from either the settings.xml, or another source
		- a check of the external source, and perhaps a user prompt to ask which to use 

application of some settings on boot up

opening a gui to allow use to make changes to settings

applying the changes to any settings when the gui is closed
	 - or on command to APPLY SETTINGS 
	 	- would need to differentiate between settings that take affect straight away vs on boot
